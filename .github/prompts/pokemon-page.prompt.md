# Build a visually appealing Pokémon page!

Create a Blazor page that displays Pokémon data using the PokeApiNet NuGet package. Focus on making the page visually appealing—use cards, images, or creative layouts to present the data. For inspiration, look at how the Weather page is structured.

**Requirements:**
- The page should be creative and visually engaging.
- Use the PokeApiNet NuGet package as the only data source for Pokémon data.
- Present each Pokémon's name, image, types, and abilities.
- Add a navigation link to your new page in the sidebar.

**How to get started:**
- Reference the Weather page for structure and layout ideas.
- For technical implementation details, see the instructions file: [pokemon-page.instructions.md](../instructions/pokemon-page.instructions.md)

**After you finish:**
- Build and run the project using the .NET CLI or VS Code Command Palette (.NET: Build, .NET: Run).
- Do not use tasks or Python commands.
