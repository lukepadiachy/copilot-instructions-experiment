# Blazor Data Services Refactor Branch

## What Was Accomplished

This branch demonstrates best practices for Blazor data access and service usage, following the instructions in `.github/instructions/blazor-data-services.instructions.md` and `.github/prompts/refactor-data-services.prompt.md`.

### Key Changes
- **Weather and Pokémon Data Refactored to Services:**
  - All data-fetching logic for Weather and Pokémon pages was moved out of Razor components and into injectable services.
  - Created `IWeatherService` and `IPokemonService` interfaces in `Interfaces/`.
  - Implemented `WeatherService` and `PokemonService` classes in `Services/`.
  - Registered services in DI in `Program.cs` using clean `using` statements.
- **Razor Pages Updated:**
  - Both `Weather.razor` and `PokemonGallery.razor` now inject their respective services and load data asynchronously using `OnInitializedAsync`.
  - All `@using` and `@inject` directives are placed at the top of each Razor file, following best practices.
  - UI logic is separated from data/business logic, improving maintainability and testability.
- **Project Structure:**
  - Models are in `Models/`, interfaces in `Interfaces/`, and services in `Services/`.
  - No inline data loading remains in Razor files.
- **Build & Run Verification:**
  - The project builds and runs successfully using the .NET CLI (`dotnet build` and `dotnet run`).
  - All pages work as expected, with loading states and error handling in place.

## How This Was Achieved
- Followed the provided instructions for Blazor data services best practices and refactoring prompts.
- Ensured all code changes were verified by building and running the project after each step.
- Used dependency injection and async/await for all data access.
- Kept the codebase clean, maintainable, and well-structured.
