# Copilot Instructions Experiment
## What This Repo Covers
This repo demonstrates **3 main ways** to customize GitHub Copilot:
1. **Custom Instructions**
   Define how Copilot should assist you – from coding style to commit message format.
2. **Prompt Files (Experimental)**
   Reusable task-specific prompts that you can run directly in chat (e.g., for code reviews, security checks, etc).
3. **Custom Chat Modes**
   Set up different behaviors and tools Copilot should use in chat.
## Why Customize Copilot?
- **No more repeats** – Tell Copilot once how you work and it remembers
- **Saves time** – Get code that fits your style and project stack
- **Easy to set up** – Instructions live in your workspace, not just your head
